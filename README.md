# Invisible-Violin

Project used with the libraries Myo ( muscle wristband hardware) and Wii Mote (not mine).
Also used the framework JUCE for the audio.
The aim of the project is to reproduce a real violin using the two hardware stated above. I wanted to help people like me who suffer from physical disability to be able to play this kind of instrument.
